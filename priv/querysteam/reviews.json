It has the leading boards on which players can compete with each other and the classic mode. However, the game probably needs more polishing. The unsatisfying part of the game is that the mining is based on the \"press\" of the mouse click not the \"release\". Once I clicked on the wrong spot, there was no way to change my mind anymore. Therefore, I would give two suggestions to the author:\n\n1) Make the \"release\" of the left button of mouses control the mining. \n2) Add some animation or effects to the \"press\", like Winmine, to allow players know better which square they are clicking on.\n\nLooking forward to seeing the gaming getting better and better.","timestamp_created":1696890823,"timestamp_updated":1697251282,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537815093994140625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"hidden_in_steam_china":true,"steam_china_location":""},{"recommendationid":"154159747","author":{"steamid":"76561197974249862","num_games_owned":1774,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1703279013},"language":"english","review":"The \"click both mouse buttons to reveal open blocks\" is so inconsistent that this is literally unplayable for me.
